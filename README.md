Hi ðŸ‘‹ I am working on Deep Learning and Computer Vision in Flying Automobile Project.

In collaboration with SoftTech Software Technologies (https://softtech.com.tr/) and Aircar Corp. (http://www.aircarcorp.com/), electric-powered vertical takeoff and landing (eVTOL) aircraft are being developed.

The projects I am working on are projects such as Semantic segmentation (Aerial images), which is used to find suitable areas where the vehicle can land during flight and to make volumetric control of these areas and positioning on the image to be activated GPS loss or Passenger mood analysis

You can access my work in all areas on my website (www.bulentsiyah.com). In addition to my website, you can review the source codes of all my works from my Kaggle and Github profiles.
